# RedBulb-Inversion
needs repentogon

Key peaces are optained by bombing the fallen angels (in room?)

# Demonic Angel ✅
Type:		14 Devil Deal \
Items:		angel pool \
> take x-items, shop:gives broken hearts  \
> taking doesn't block angel 

# Angelic Devil ✅
Type:		15 Angel Room \
Items:		devil pool 
> take one item, free  \
> taking blocks angel 

# Synergies
The Stairway ✅
> evil beggars \
> sanguine bond spike instead of shop 
Sanguine Bond \
> add 1 shop item into the room (similar to "The Stairway")

# ToDo:
modify sanguine bond \
make unlockable (1 angel + 1 devil in one run) \
make findable \
unwanted behavior with dataHolder: 
> spawn item in demonic Angel, leave, reenter: on pickup: player gets broken heart \
> spawn itme in angelic Devil, leav, reenter: on pickup: blocks Angel 
stairway rooms: get rid of spikes (sanguine spawns one) -> VM \
switch sprites 
> door chaos 
greed --maybe done? \
room for sheal/cathedral even without unlocked --maybe done?

# Basement Renovator:
Nulls -> Blue Gaper \
Mom's Hand/Mom's Dead Hand - > Greed Gaper \
Begotten -> Clicketyclack \
Imp - > Angelic Baby \
Evil Twin - > Dead Isaac (if possible, if not, replace with Blue Gaper) \
Black Maw - > Holy Leech \
Black Gobin's Head - > Angelic Mulligun \
Wizoob should be unchanged \
Soul Sucker - > Bulb \
Bloodshot Eye - > Holy Eye

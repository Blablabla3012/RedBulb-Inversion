<a/>

Sanguine Bond ✅
* no sanguine bond spikes in demonic Angel
* spawn confessional in angelic devil
    * spawns in center of room -> maybe change position, but: layout is "dangerous"
<a/>

# ToDo:
unwanted behavior with dataHolder: 
* spawn item in demonic Angel, leave, reenter: on pickup: player gets broken heart
* spawn item in angelic Devil, leave, reenter: on pickup: blocks Angel
<a/>

switch sprites 
* door chaos
<a/>

stairway
* every shop item is an collectible -> because spawns in an devil deal: the shop pool in devil = collectibles
    * needs to be Angel? + give pound of flesh
    * need Basement Renovator to work further
<a/>

greed
* itempools.xml ✅
* code should work?
<a/>

room for sheol/cathedral without unlocked (early Game) --maybe done? \
get sprites:
* item
* unlock sheet
* rooms and doors
<a/>

# Basement Renovator:
Nulls -> Blue Gaper \
Mom's Hand/Mom's Dead Hand - > Greed Gaper \

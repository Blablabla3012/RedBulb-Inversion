needs repentogon

Key peaces are optained by bombing the fallen angels (in room?)

# Demonic Angel ✅
Type:		14 Devil Deal \
Items:		angel pool

* take x-items, shop:gives broken hearts
* taking doesn't block angel 

# Angelic Devil ✅
Type:		15 Angel Room \
Items:		devil pool

* take one item, free
* taking blocks angel 

# Synergies
The Stairway
 
* evil beggars
* pound of flesh for items
<a/>
Sanguine Bond

* he/she told me nothing, my idea:
    * no sanguine bond spikes in demonic Angel ✅
    * add 1 shop item into the room (similar to "The Stairway")

# ToDo:
stairway \
sanguine \
make unlockable (1 angel + 1 devil in one run) \
make findable \
unwanted behavior with dataHolder: 
* spawn item in demonic Angel, leave, reenter: on pickup: player gets broken heart
* spawn item in angelic Devil, leav, reenter: on pickup: blocks Angel
<a/>
stairway rooms: get rid of spikes (sanguine spawns one) -> VM

switch sprites 
* door chaos
<a/>
greed --maybe done?

room for sheal/cathedral even without unlocked --maybe done?

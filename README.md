# ToDo:
sanguine \
make findable \
unwanted behavior with dataHolder:

<a/>

switch sprites 
* door chaos
<a/>

stairway
* every shop item is an collectible -> because spawns in an devil deal: the shop pool in devil = collectibles
    * needs to be Angel? + give pound of flesh
    * need Basement Renovator to work further
<a/>

greed --maybe done? \
room for sheal/cathedral without unlocked (early Game) --maybe done? \
